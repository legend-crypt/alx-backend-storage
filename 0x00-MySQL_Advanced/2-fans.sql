--- Write a SQL script that ranks country origins of bands, ordered by the number of (non-unique) fans
--- Context: Calculate/compute something is always power intensiveâ€¦ better to distribute the load!
--- Column names must be: origin and nb_fans




SELECT origin, SUM(fans) nb_fans 
FROM 
    metal_bands 
GROUP BY 
    origin 
ORDER BY 
    nb_fans DSEC;
